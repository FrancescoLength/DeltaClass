Below are the key pointers/focus areas prepared by panel based on the feedback received till now .These are also reviewed /enhanced  by customer. cover these aspects in your submissions:
1. Implement code changes for all the tasks mentioned in the code assignment MD file(s)
2. Document unit-testing and write the Junit test cases for positive, negative or error conditions.
3. Track the source-code coverage using Code coverage tools such as JaCoCo (Expected – 80% or above)
4. Follow the software development best practices such as Code Quality, Coding Standards, Exception Handling & Logging etc.
5. Understand the case study scenarios and document the challenges and strategies or solutions for the same
6. Finally, push changes to your GitHub repository and share the link. Also, you may consider adding CI/CD pipelines and health checks as good-to-have requirements.
7. AI usage is allowed and encouraged. But evaluation of the code and case study response will also be done in terms of unnecessary or too sparse content (which a unsupervised usage of AI produces).
